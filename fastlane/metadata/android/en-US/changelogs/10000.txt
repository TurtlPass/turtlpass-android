Say goodbye to weak passwords and hello to ultimate online security with the first major release of TurtlPass Android, version 1.0.0!

TurtlPass Android makes it a breeze to send a secure hash of your App Domain, Account ID, and PIN to the TurtlPass Firmware via USB. Just press the physical button on the device, watch as the firmware emulates an external keyboard, and type the password for you, ensuring that it is never transmitted over potentially insecure channels.

With these fantastic features, you'll be able to:

  - Choose the app you want to generate a password for from the list of installed apps on your device
  - Load the image associated with the user account when the account doesn't have a contact photo already
  - Save time by not having to re-enter your Account ID every time
  - Use the TurtlPass firmware device to communicate with the app via USB serial port

Upgrade your online security game with TurtlPass. We can't wait to hear your feedback and bring you even more exciting features and improvements in the future. Thank you for choosing the ultimate password solution.
