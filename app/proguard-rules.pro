# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the

-keepattributes LineNumberTable,SourceFile

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment to hide the original source file name

# It helps in preserving some attributes that may be required for reflection.
# For example, the Exceptions, InnerClasses, and Signature attributes are used when processing a library.
# SourceFile and LineNumberTable attributes for producing obfuscated stack traces with source file name
# and line number of method. Annotation to keep all the annotations used.
