        networkSecurityConfig is defined in core-network so that all feature modules
        automatically inherit the same security policy.

        Why this is important:
        - Controls whether cleartext (HTTP) traffic is allowed.
        - Defines which certificate authorities are trusted.
        - Restricts which domains the app can connect to.
        - Ensures consistent TLS behavior across debug and release builds.
        - Works together with OkHttp certificate pinning for enhanced security.

        By declaring it here in the library manifest, we avoid duplicating this
        configuration in every module and ensure a single, centralized security policy.
